### Licensing and Governance

JAXB is licensed under a dual license - CDDL 1.1 and GPL 2.0 with Class-path Exception. 
That means you can choose which one of the two suits your needs better and use it under those terms.

We use <a href="http://glassfish.java.net/public/GovernancePolicy.html">GlassFish Governance Policy</a>, 
which means we can only accept contributions under the 
terms of <a href="http://oracle.com/technetwork/goto/oca">OCA</a>.
